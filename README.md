### Installation

#### Prerequisites

This extension [requires GNOME Shell v3.26 or later](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/blob/master/system-monitor%40paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com/metadata.json#L2).

Before installing this extension, ensure you have the necessary system packages installed:

* On Ubuntu:

      sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gnome-system-monitor

* On Debian:

      sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gnome-system-monitor

* On Fedora:

      sudo dnf install libgtop2-devel NetworkManager-libnm-devel gnome-system-monitor

* On Arch Linux:

      sudo pacman -S libgtop networkmanager gnome-system-monitor clutter

* On openSUSE (Leap 42.1):

      sudo zypper install gnome-shell-devel libgtop-devel libgtop-2_0-10 gnome-system-monitor

* On Mageia 64-bit (just remove "64" on i586):

      sudo urpmi lib64gtop-gir2.0 lib64nm-gir1.0 lib64clutter-gir1.0 gnome-system-monitor

    or

      sudo dnf install lib64gtop-gir2.0 lib64nm-gir1.0 lib64clutter-gir1.0 gnome-system-monitor


Additionally, if you have an NVIDIA graphics card, and want to monitor its memory usage, you'll need to install `nvidia-smi`.

For the browser installation (recommended), you will need the GNOME Shell integration browser extension for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep),
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/) or
[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/gnome-shell-integration/).

Note: If you're using Firefox 52 or later, [you will also need to install `chrome-gnome-shell`](https://blogs.gnome.org/ne0sight/2016/12/25/how-to-install-gnome-shell-extensions-with-firefox-52/).
The instructions are available [on the GNOME wiki](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation#Ubuntu_Linux).

#### Browser installation

It's recommended you install the extension via the Gnome Shell Extensions website.

Visit [this extension's page on extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/120/system-monitor/),
preferably in Firefox, and install by clicking the toggle button next to the extension's name.

If the install was successful, the toggle button should now show "ON".
If it failed, ensure that you installed all the [necessary dependencies](#prerequisites),
and that you granted the browser permission to install extensions when prompted.
Additionally, rebooting gnome-shell may help (type `Alt + F2` and input `r` in the prompt), but it won't work with Wayland.

#### Repository installation

* Extension is in Fedora onwards (up to Fedora 33, last update) and Rawhide repositories, you can install it for all users with the following command:

      sudo dnf install gnome-shell-extension-system-monitor-applet

* Enable it with `gnome-tweak-tool` or `gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable-extension=system-monitor@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com`

#### Manual installation

[Download the ZIP/Tarball](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/releases),
extract the archive, open a shell into its directory, and run:

    make install

Alternately, if you plan on doing development on the extension, or testing modifications, it's advised you checkout the Git repository and install a symlink. First, install git if you don't have it: (`sudo apt-get install git-core`, `sudo pacman -S git`, etc.), then run:

    GIT_PROJECTS=~/git_projects
    PROJECT_NAME=gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet
    mkdir $GIT_PROJECTS
    cd $GIT_PROJECTS
    git clone git://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet.git $PROJECT_NAME
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
    cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
    { [ -d "./$PROJECT_NAME" ] || [ -L "./$PROJECT_NAME" ]; } && rm -Rf "./$PROJECT_NAME"
    ln -s $GIT_PROJECTS/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/$PROJECT_NAME
    gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable-extension=$PROJECT_NAME
    gnome-extensions enable system-monitor@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com

And reload GNOME Shell (`Alt + F2`, then `r`) or restart your GNOME session if you are using Wayland.

On openSUSE you need to install a devel package that provides the `gnome-shell-extension-tool` command:

    sudo zypper install gnome-shell-devel

### Development

#### Translation

If we do not have the translation for your language and you want to translate it by yourself, please make a fork, add your `po/<YOUR_LANG>/system-monitor-applet.po` file, and make a pull request.

#### Testing

Testing can be done on your native Linux environment using the install instructions above, or through Docker.

To build and run a Docker image:

    ./build-docker.sh
    ./run-docker.sh

To connect to the container's desktop through VNC:

    ./open-docker.sh

Once logged in, you'll still need to manually enable the extension by open the Gnome Tweaks tool.

Afterwards, when you're done testing, you can destroy the container with:

    ./close-docker.sh

#### Deployment
    
1. To create a ZIP file with the specified version number, ready to upload to [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) or similar repository, run:

    make zip-file VERSION=<version>

To determine the version number to use, check the extensions site and increment from the largest published version.

The specified version number is just for documentation and isn't strictly necessary in the uploaded file, since the extensions website will dynamically set this and override whatever we enter.

2. Once uploaded, [create a GitHub release](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/releases) with the same version number.
